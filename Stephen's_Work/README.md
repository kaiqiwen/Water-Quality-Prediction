# Reasoning for Model

Because we are dealing with spatio-temporal data, aiming to predict water quality (pH) based on historical water indices for multiple locations. This requires a model capable of capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies. As such a model that can do both is a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), a variant of the LSTM neural network that uses convolutional layers to process spatial and temporal information.
